# Diego-Cisneros

# 👋 Hi, I'm Diego Cisneros

I'm a **Jr. Full-Stack Developer** based in Barcelona with a unique blend of experience across **sales, business management, and software development**.

Originally from an international business and real estate background, I’ve led high-performing sales teams, run digital marketing strategies, and built long-term client pipelines — and now, I’m channeling all that drive into building clean, scalable web applications.

In 2024, I completed the **Ironhack Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** in Barcelona, where I learned to create full-stack applications using the **MERN stack**, with a strong focus on React, TypeScript, and responsive design.



## 💼 Past Experience (Highlights)

- 🏢 **Real Estate Manager** at Cisneros y Asociados  
  Built digital lead funnels, increased client base by 25%, led CRM and marketing automation

- 💻 **Sales Team Lead** at RushHour (B2B SaaS)  
  Managed a 3-person SDR/BDR team, improved conversion rate, handled full-cycle sales

- 📈 **Business Development @ Feeder**  
  Closed over 60% of leads weekly through multi-channel campaigns



## 🧠 Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+)
- React Router, Context API
- HTML5, CSS3, TailwindCSS (in progress)

**Backend**
- Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- REST APIs, MVC architecture

**Tools**
- Git & GitHub, Vite, npm, Postman
- HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Analytics (from past experience)



##  Current Projects

-  [Gran Turismo Panamá Website](https://github.com/Kasper1-2/GTP-web)  
  A sim racing team website featuring dynamic sections, interactive driver cards, and brand-based styling

-  Esports team site (in development)  
  Full responsive front-end with smooth scroll and section transitions

-  Custom scripts and bots  
  Mini tools for automating tasks like ticket availability monitoring



##  Looking For

I'm actively looking to transition full-time into **front-end** or **full-stack web development** roles. I'm especially excited about:

- Working on high-impact products
- Joining a dev team where I can learn, grow, and contribute from day one
- Companies that value collaboration, creativity, and initiative
